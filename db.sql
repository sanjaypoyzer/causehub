It is a process in which we enterprising humans pump special fluid a potion made of water, sand, and mysterious chemical additives deep into the ground, releasing natural gas and oil that is trapped in shale or sand. The gas was happy there. The rock layers were protecting it. But now it''s ours, all ours! Muahahaha.\\n\\nFans of fracking cite the fact that natural gas is cheap, abundant, and relatively clean\\\\-burning. The booming industry makes people feel happy about energy independence, creates jobs, and boosts local economies why, one pizza shop in South Dakota reportedly made $1 million after fracking came to town!\\n\\nBut there''s trouble in River City:\\n"}},{"type":"list","data":{"text":" - **Fracking can contaminate water.** Just ask the people in Dimock, Penn, where methane from gas wells apparently [contaminated household water](http://articles.philly.com/2012\\\\-08\\\\-27/news/33403570\\\\_1\\\\_susquehanna\\\\-county\\\\-town\\\\-cabot\\\\-oil\\\\-baby\\\\-drill).

Stay tuned.\\n - **Fracking causes earthquakes.** Or rather, the injection of wastewater from the fracking process into the ground causes earthquakes. It has caused earthquakes in Ohio, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, and other places. Recent research suggests it also makes earthquakes more likely here when major quakes strike across the globe.

People near wells have indeed complained of headaches, nausea, nosebleeds, breathing issues, and memory loss, and a [report](http://www.motherjones.com/blue\\\\-marble/2013/07/earthquakes\\\\-triggered\\\\-more\\\\-earthquakes\\\\-near\\\\-us\\\\-fracking\\\\-sites) from the Center for Environmental Health says proximity to the operations is particularly risky for pregnant women and young children.

It wasâ€¦ uhâ€¦ porno. Yeah, that''s it. Well, thanks to the Internet, I''m now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

OK, if everyone''s finished being stupid. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn''t I break his legs? Tell her she looks thin.\\n\\nA true inspiration for the children.

1. 23, Web Developer, East London
2. 
  + Macbook Pro, iPhone 5.
  + About 12 hours a day on the Macbook, probably like 2 on the iPhone.
  + Chrome most of the time on both.
3.
  + Twitter, Facebook, word of mouth with colleagues, housemates and other friends. In that order.
  + Accessiblity for people with differing abilities, and generally equality for everyone.
  + I try to make sure my work reflects what I believe in and care about, so I've worked with projects that do great things with people with disabilities and when I develop I use accessible practices.
  + Very occassionally I will sign petitions but I'm skeptical about their impact. I sometimes discuss topical social issues on Facebook but I don't feel like that has much worth.

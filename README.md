#CauseHub.

##"A decentralised, open source toolkit for people to gather around a common cause." 

Initially created and conceived at #Hack4Good London in October 2013, CauseHub is evolving into a toolkit for people to fight causes with the help of relevant data.

We are currently going through a rebuild, will publish more info soon!
